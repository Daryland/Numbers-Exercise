    Exercise
    
    Consider this scenario: You have a shopping cart with 6 items in it.  The total price of all the items combined is $78.50 You have a coupon that gets you 25% off of the total price. After the coupon is applied, taxes will be applied at a rate of 7.75% of the total cost (cost after coupon).
    
        Create 6 different variables that represent the price of each item
        Perform addition operations to get the total price of all 6 items and store it in a variable ($78.50)
        Create a variable for the 25% coupon
        Create a variable called priceAfterDiscount and store the total price after the 25% discount has been applied (should equal around $58.87)
        Create a variable called taxes that stores the total taxes to be charged using the tax rate (should equal around $4.56)
        Create a variable called finalPrice that applies the 7.75% tax rate to priceAfterDicscount.  (should equal around $63.43)
